Hey! I am Fabrizio. I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at Technion, working with [Prof. Haggai Maron](https://haggaim.github.io/) on _Geometric Deep Learning_.

My interests revolve around _principled and effective learning over structured data_, with particular emphasis on the roles of _Equivariance_ and _Expressiveness_. Recently, I've been working on architectures to learn from (structured) computational traces of Large Language Models (LLMs) for the automated detection of problematic behavioral patterns such as hallucinations. I also extensively work on methods for learning on graphs, with a focus on designing efficient and expressive Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).

Speaking of graphs, I am also one of the co-founders and co-organisers of the [GLOW (Graph Learning on Wednesdays)](https://sites.google.com/view/graph-learning-on-weds) reading group.

Previously, I have obtained a PhD in Computing from Imperial College London under the supervision of Prof. Michael Bronstein, with my research focussing on overcoming the intrinsic representational limits of GNNs. I have explored extensions of message-passing schemes that can capture non-trivial meso-scale topological patterns in networks, and equivariance to symmetries as an overarching design principle to design provably expressive architectures.

In the past, I have conducted more applied research on Machine Learning approaches for problems in the realm of Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, specifically, drug repurposing and epigenetic gene expression regulation.

I have also been a Machine Learning Researcher at Twitter Cortex from 2019 – acquisition of [Fabula AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabula_AI) – to early 2023.
