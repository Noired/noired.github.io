Hey! I am Fabrizio. I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at Technion, the Israel Institute of Technology. I work with [Prof. Haggai Maron](https://haggaim.github.io/) on _Geometric Deep Learning_ and, in particular, _Equivariance_, _Expressiveness_, _Graph Neural Networks_.

I am also one of the co-organisers of the GLOW (Graph Learning on Wednesdays) reading group – take a peek into it [here](https://sites.google.com/view/graph-learning-on-weds).

Previously, I have obtained a PhD in Computing from Imperial College London under the supervision of Prof. Michael Bronstein, with my research focussing on overcoming the intrinsic representational limits of Graph Neural Network. I have explored extensions of message-passing schemes that can capture non-trivial meso-scale topological patterns in networks, and equivariance to symmetries as an overarching design principle to design provably expressive architectures.

In the past, I have conducted more applied research revolving around the application of Machine Learning approaches to problems in the realm of Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, in particular: drug repurposing and epigenetic gene expression regulation.

I have also been a Machine Learning Researcher at Twitter Cortex from 2019 – acquisition of [Fabula AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabula_AI) – to early 2023.
